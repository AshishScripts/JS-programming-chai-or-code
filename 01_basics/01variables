/*
use of semicolon is optional
let and var are both used to declare variables

let (block-scoped):
A variable declared with let is only accessible within the block ({}) where it is defined. This makes let safer to use, especially in loops and conditional statements.

var (function-scoped):
A variable declared with var is accessible throughout the entire function where it's defined, or globally if declared outside a function. It ignores block boundaries (like {}) unless they are part of a function

Use let:
In modern JavaScript, it's recommended to use let (or const for variables that donâ€™t change) because it reduces the risk of bugs caused by scope issues or accidental re-declarations.
